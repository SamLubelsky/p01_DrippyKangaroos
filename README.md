Our project is a news site which aggregates other news site to make a news feed which covers topics from multiple angles.  We will use news data, weather data, and stock data pulling from at least three apis. 
Our news site is unique in that we will generate a list of current events and then for each current event we will display multiple articles from different sources about that event, instead of just having one article for each topic like most newsfeeds are designed to do.  The general design will be relatively minimalistic, with just a homepage showing all the topics of the day and a search bar allowing the user to search through these topics.
